In this project, we have utilized xv6 -a Unix based operating system- and applied different conversions in several steps to make it more efficent and practical.
Firstly we added ability to use right and left arrows to move cursor among characters and up and down arrows to travel through previous commands in command line. Also some new commands has been added such as "history" to see ten previous commands. Also a new syntax which calculates mathematical expression at once in a command and also the ablity to copy and paste in command line. Also a user program to encode and decode a text.
In second step, we added some system calls to our system and manipulated process structure to store different syscalls it invokes.
In third step, we changed the cpu scheduling system and utilized a multilevel schuduler which consists of three levels with different time slice portions. Also any of these levels has been implemented with a different method: FCFS, SJF and RR.
In forth step, we designed a new type of lock and utilzied it prevent some impending risks of processes being blocked.
Finally, in fifth step, we addressed into memory mangement concepts and appended shared memory into this operating system.
